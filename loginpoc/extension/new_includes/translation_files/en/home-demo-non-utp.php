            £10,000 Prize Terms and Conditions: Only applicable to PipIndex Capital Markets customers that transfer the balance of their trading accounts to ETX Capital and place an initial trade during the promotion period specified above, or to customers who upgrade from demo to live account during the period and place their first trade with ETX Capital. The rules are simple but we must say them out loud; upgrade your account, place your trade to enter the competition and you might be drawn as the lucky winner.

Should there be any foreign exchange or other bank charges such will be the responsibility of the fortunate recipient. The deadlines for the first trade prize are given with ample time hence neither PipIndex, nor ETX Capital, nor Finsa Europe Limited accept any responsibility for delays in opening or closing trading accounts, in remitting funds, or otherwise allowing a trade deal to be placed so as the customer is eligible to meet the terms and conditions of this prize draw.
